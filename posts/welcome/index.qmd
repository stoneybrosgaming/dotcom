<!-- Left this to show how to add a picutre -->

Raised in the desert on Missile Command, Ms. Pac-Man and fruit punch Gatorade, we are *The* OG of the OG gamers. As mere pups in the glorious golden era of arcades, we had already cut our baby teeth on the likes of Berzerk!, Rampage, and Dragon's Lair when the NES arrived and bound us as brothers forever. Now we are dads and the world is better for it somehow and but so we play on. We roll more than quarters, yo.

end of line.
